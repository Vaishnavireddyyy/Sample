    <p>
      GitHub is a cloud-based platform that helps developers manage and share
      code using Git, a version control system. It allows individuals and teams
      to collaborate on projects by tracking changes, managing versions, and
      reviewing code through features like commits, branches, and pull requests.
      With GitHub, you can host repositories online, contribute to open-source
      projects, and maintain a history of your work. Itâ€™s widely used in
      software development for both personal and professional projects, making
      it easier to work together, fix bugs, and build better software
      efficiently. Whether you're a beginner learning to code or part of a large
      development team, GitHub provides the tools to streamline your workflow
      and foster collaboration.
